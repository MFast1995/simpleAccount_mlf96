Welcome to The Simple Account Program

Upon running the program, the system will prompt you to enter the input file name.
Ensure the input file is in the input folder or the program will not find the file.
Enter the name of the file, with extension, and hit enter.

EXAMPLE: clients.txt 

	The IDs and balances cannot contain any letter else the program will display errors

This will prompt the program to begin. The ComboBox will be populated with all 
names from the input file.

Select a name. Then click on an edit in... button which will bring another window. From 
there, enter a numerical value into the text field. All letters will be ignored. Then 
withdraw and deposit money.

Once done, exit out of the window and click exit or save. Save will allow you to continue in the main window while exit will save and close the program.
